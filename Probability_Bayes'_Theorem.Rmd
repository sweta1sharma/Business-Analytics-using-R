# Assigment 3

## 1. Event Types

### a. Just Mutually exclusive

### b. None of the above

### c. Just Mutually exclusive

### d.Mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive

## 6.  A company researches travel claims. The probability that a claim includes service A or service B is 0.85. The probability that a claim does not include service A charges is 0.25. Charges for service A and service B are independent.What is the probability that a claim includes service B charges.
## (A) 0.10 (B) 0.20 (C) 0.25 (D) 0.40 (E) 0.80

## P(A or B) = 0.85

# P(Not A) = 0.25

# P(A) = 0.75

# A and B are independent

# P(B) = ?

# P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A AND B)

# 0.85 = 0.75 + P(B) - [P(A)*P(B)]

# 0.1 = P(B) - 0.75* P(B)

# 0.1 = 0.25 P(B)

# P(B) = 0.40 # The answer is D

## 7. A health study tracked a group of persons for five years. At the beginning of the study, 20% were classified as heavy smokers, 30% as light smokers, and 50% as nonsmokers. Results of the study showed that light smokers were twice as likely as nonsmokers to die during the five-year study, but only half as likely as heavy smokers. A randomly selected participant from the study died over the five- year period. Calculate the probability that the participant was a heavy smoker.
# (A) 0.20 (B) 0.25 (C) 0.35 (D) 0.42 (E) 0.57

### HS = 20% 0.20

### LS = 30% = 0.30

### NS = 50% = 0.50

### P(D) = P(Die)

### P(D | LS) = 2* P(D | NS) = P(D | HS) / 2

### Using Bayes theoram

### P(HS | D) =  [P(D|HS) * P(HS)]/[P(D|HS)* P(HS) + P(D | LS) * P(LS) + P(D | NS) * P(NS)]

### P(HS | D) = [2 * P (D | LS) * 0.20]/[2 * P (D | LS) * 0.20 + P(D | LS) * 0.30 + {P(D | LS)/2} * .50]

### P(HS | D) = [2 * P (D | LS) * 0.20]/ [P(D | LS)* {2 * 0.20 + 0.30 + 1/2 * 0.50}]

### P (D | LS) cancels out in the numerator and denominator

### P(HS | D) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.30 + 0.25]

### P(HS | D) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.30 + 0.25]

### P(HS | D) = 0.4 /0.95

### P(HS | D) = 0.42 # The answer is D
